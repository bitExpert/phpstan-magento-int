# bitexpert/phpstan-magento-int

This repository contains some integration tests for the [bitexpert/phpstan-magento](https://github.com/bitExpert/phpstan-magento) PHPStan extension.

The latest released versions of PHPStan and the bitExpert/phpstan-magento extension are tested against
a standalone module as well as a fully bootstrapped Magento platform instance.

The code of the Magento module does not make sense, it's purely there to test the different features that
the bitExpert/phpstan-magento extension supports.
